      "3 sprigs fresh basil, leaves torn",
      "sea salt and freshly ground black pepper"
    ],
    "ingredients": "bread tomato garlic bacon egg spinach mustard",
    "method": "Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.  Tear the bread into bite-sized pieces and scatter in an even layer over a baking tray. Drizzle with a little olive oil.  Place the tomatoes onto a separate tray, scatter with the sliced garlic, placing slices on top of the tomatoes and season with pepper. Place both trays in the oven for 8-10 minutes, or until the bread is golden-brown and crisp. Set aside and leave to cool.  Heat a griddle pan over a high heat until hot. Fry the bacon until charred on both sides and cooked through. Once cooked, chop into small pieces.  For the dressing, place all the ingredients into a clean jam jar or a small watertight tub. Add two tablespoons of water and seal. Shake until emulsified. Season with salt and pepper to taste. (The dressing can be stored and used in other dishes as it will make more than you need for this salad.)  Bring a large pan of water to a simmer and add the white wine vinegar (don’t be tempted to add salt as this will cause the egg whites to disintegrate and will ruin your poached eggs). Crack the eggs into a small ramekin or dish. Briefly whisk the water to create a vortex before gently pouring the cracked eggs into the centre of the slowly spinning water. Poach for four minutes in gently simmering water, or until cooked to your liking. Remove from the pan and drain thoroughly on kitchen paper.  To serve, put the bread pieces, roasted tomatoes, three-quarters of the chopped bacon and all of the spinach and basil into a large bowl. Spoon over 1-2 tablespoons of the dressing and toss to combine. Place onto serving plates and top with a poached egg. Season with pepper and sprinkle over the remaining bacon bits. Serve immediately."

    ],
    "ingredients": "salmon lemon thyme",
    "method": "To make the poached salmon, dissolve the stock cube in the boiling water and pour into a saucepan. Add the lemon slices and enough water to come 5cm/2in up the side of the pan (approximately 600ml/1 pint). Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer.Season the salmon with salt and pepper on both sides, then lower into the pan skin side down and simmer for 8–10 minutes, depending on the size of the fillets, until opaque. Remove from the heat, uncover and leave to stand in the poaching liquid for 5 minutes. Resting helps the salmon stay intact. Carefully remove the salmon and serve immediately or leave to cool and chill in the fridge, until ready to use. To make the salmon en papillote, preheat the oven to 190C/170C Fan/Gas 5. Season the salmon with salt and pepper and place just off centre on a square sheet of greaseproof paper. Lay the lemon slices and thyme on top of the salmon. Fold the greaseproof paper in half over the salmon and double fold around the edges to create a seal.Put the papillote on a baking tray and bake for 12–15 minutes. Carefully open the packet to allow the steam to escape. Remove the thyme and serve immediately. To make the pan-fried salmon, rub each fillet with chilli powder, 1 tablespoon of oil and season with salt and pepper. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil in a frying pan over a medium-high heat. Once hot, add the salmon skin side down and cook for 4 minutes, until the skin is crisp. Turn and cook for a further 3 minutes. Remove from the pan and serve immediately."

      "1.2 litres/2 pints stock (see above, or chicken stock",
      "1 tbsp softened butter",
      "1-2 tbsp plain flour"
    ],
    "ingredientsList": [
      "4.5-5.5kg/10-12lb whole turkey, with giblets",
      "1 onion, halved",
      "1 carrot",
      "2 celery sticks",
      "2 sprigs of fresh parsley",
      "2 sprigs of fresh thyme",
      "175g/6oz butter",
      "flaked sea salt and freshly ground black pepper"
    ],
    "ingredients": "turkey onion celery parsley thyme butter flour",
    "method": "For the stock, put the giblets, onion, carrot, celery and herbs in a saucepan and season. Cover with about 2 litres/3½ pints cold water and bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 2 hours, or until you have a flavoursome stock. Strain and set aside for making the gravy. (The stock can be made a day or two in advance; cover and store in the fridge, then skim any fat from the top.) Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6. For the stuffing, melt the butter in a saucepan over a medium heat. When it is foaming, add the chopped onions and season. Cover with greaseproof paper and a lid, turn the heat to low and cook for 8-10 minutes, or until completely softened. Set aside to cool. Put the cooled onions in a mixing bowl. Mix in the breadcrumbs and mixed herbs and season to taste. Weigh the stuffing to assist with calculating the cooking time.  Season the turkey cavity at both ends. Stuff some of the stuffing into the main cavity, but be careful not to pack it in - there must be enough space between the stuffing and breastbone to fit the handle of a wooden spoon. Stuff the smaller cavity at the neck end, again leaving a little space. Put the turkey into a large roasting tray. Melt the 175g/6oz butter, then soak the muslin in the butter and wrap it over the turkey. To calculate the cooking time, add the weight of the turkey and stuffing together. Roast for 15 minutes, then turn the oven down to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4 and roast for 15 minutes per 450g/1lb of the total weight. Baste with the juices every 30 minutes; it is important to do this quickly so as to not let the turkey cool down, as this could alter the cooking time. Remove the muslin 15 minutes before the end of roasting and baste again. To test if the turkey is cooked, insert a small fruit or vegetable knife into the thicktest part of the meat, between the leg and breast; the juices that run should be clear, with no sign of pink; if there is any pink, return the turkey to the oven for another 15-20 minutes, or until cooked through. Tranfer the turkey to a carving dish. Cover it with parchment paper, then place a clean tea-towel over it to keep it nice and snug. Leave it to rest for at least 30 minutes, or up to 1½ hours. Meanwhile, for the gravy, skim off the fat from the roasting tray with a spoon. Place the tray on a medium heat and deglaze it by pouring in the stock. Using a whisk, scrape free all the caramelised bits on the bottom of the tray. Bring the mixture to the boil, then carefully pour it into a saucepan through a sieve and season. To thicken the gravy, mix together the butter and flour, then whisk it into the gravy. Bring the mixture to a simmer, then remove from the heat. Carve the turkey and serve on warm plates with the stuffing and hot gravy."
